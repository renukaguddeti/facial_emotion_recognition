This Facial Emotion Detection project uses deep learning and computer vision to recognize human emotions in real-time. It leverages:

✅ TensorFlow/Keras – For building and training a CNN model to classify emotions.
✅ OpenCV – For face detection using Haarcascade.
✅ NumPy & Pandas – For data handling and preprocessing.
✅ Matplotlib – To visualize training results.
✅ H5 Model Format – Saves and loads the trained model.

The model classifies 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise from facial expressions in real-time using a webcam.
